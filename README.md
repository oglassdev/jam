# Game Jam

(See also: [Resource Pack](./resource_pack/README.md))

This is our game!!!

### Notes

- If you want colors in your output, use the flag `-Djansi.passthrough=true`
- Be sure to use the `team.ktusers.jam.Json` and `team.ktusers.jam.AdventureNbt` imports instead of the default ones,
  since they have the Minestom modules.
